## _**What are the challenges that mappers experience while utilizing AI data on OpenStreetMap?**_

- ### Overview
  fAIr does mapping in the same way as human mappers using HOTs Tasking Manager. It looks at UAV imagery and produces map data that can be added to the OSM. Tests show a 100% speedup compared to manual mapping. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accomplish this.

  fAIr is developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and all the software is free and open source.

  Before fAIr is used it needs to be fine-tuned by training on high quality map data for a small representative part of the geographical region where it is to be used
  
- ### Quality of AI Data
  One of the primary challenges faced by mappers when using AI data on OpenStreetMap is the quality of the data. The accuracy and completeness of AI data depends on the quality of the training data used to train the AI model. If the training data is biased or incomplete, the AI model will produce inaccurate results and this has happened in some cases especially with roads. Mappers must therefore carefully assess the quality of the AI data before adding it to OSM.
- ### Data integration process.
  Another challenge faced by mappers is the integration process. Foexample, when using using Mapwithai, one has to always pick potions of data from the AI layer if they are buildings, one picks a maximum of less that 100 buildings and pastes them in the OSM data layer and does the same for all the buildings in that particular area or tile or layer.
- ### Technical Expertise
  The use of AI technology in mapping requires technical expertise, which can be a significant challenge for mappers who may not have the necessary skills. For instance, beginer Mappers can not be recommended or trained to use these AI tools as they may mess the entire area. Therefore frequent trainings are needed for mappers to be equipped with adquet skills of handling such tasks.
- ### Imagery offsets
  The AI technologies for example AI data from Microsoft was and is generated using Bing Imagery which in several cases is older compared to the recent Imageries like Maxar Premium. The imposes a big challenge in aligning the AI data with the latest imageries.

### Here the HOTâ€™s open AI-assisted mapping service: fAIr comes to rescue .
The fAIr tool is also an open-source mapping tool with AI assistance, and the AI models it uses are developed and trained by people who reside in and work in nearby towns. To know more about fAIr check the **About** page.
